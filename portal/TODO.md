# TODO on the portal application

I think I am going to start with the reciever and work backwards. 
It at least makes the most sense in my head. 
Also, the below to do list is not in any specific order.
However, I'm willing to bet if I finish the reciever app and get it working with this app, most of the project will be done.

## To do list:
 - receive a notificaition from the reciever
 - send notification back to receiver
 - download file
 - error handeling
 - file storage
 - file sending
 - recieve a notification from the sender
 - send a notification back to the sender
 - logical error handling in the event of connection breaks
