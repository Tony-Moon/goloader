# TODO on the reciever application

I think I am going to start here and work backwards. 
It at least makes the most sense in my head. 
Also, the below to do list is not in any specific order.
However, I'm willing to bet if I finish this app and get it working with the portal, most of the project will be done.

## To do list:
 - receive a notificaition from the portal
 - send notification back to portal
 - download file
 - error handeling
 - file storage
