# TODO on the sender application

I think I am going to start at the reciever application and work backwards. 
It at least makes the most sense in my head. 
Also, the below to do list is not in any specific order.
However, I'm willing to bet if I finish the reciever and get it working with the portal, most of the project will be done.

## To do list:
 - receive a notificaition from the portal
 - send notification back to portal
 - file uploading
 - error handeling
 - file storage
 - file finding
